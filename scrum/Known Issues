App Exit during training also exits current run, wont be able to classify

Users can’t access previously trained models yet
Always need to train a model before submitting a prediction currently

Images sent to the server should be kept under 10MB

Not thoroughly tested for unexpected inputs to model

You should not mess up the busy cats.(don’t exit app while it’s loading)

User data not secure going to Flask server

No logout button, must be done with android “back” button

Not a lot of in app explanation, not new user friendly

Does not directly teach about Machine Learning, more of a sample for now.

Only one user may train at a time, does not support concurrent users

Datasets are not all of the same quality.

App not formatted properly for all phones

Crashing on image upload from phone sometimes

Sample data for some datasets not showing properly, showing chihuahua instead

Crashing on larger loads

Cannot train on a single dataset

Training result images do not open in a nice/usable format

Occasionally will show past training/layer images instead of Results from the current run


If the server crashes during training, the app will experience unexpected behaviour

If the server crashes unexpectedly, previously saved models may be lost

Will only classify on RGB images, not set up for images with extra transparency/color  layer
